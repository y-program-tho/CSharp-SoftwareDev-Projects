### OOP Radio Miniproject

## Process
Issue the project brief after the Classes and Structs lesson and give them several days to complete it.

Ask a few students to demonstrate their progress (and get help with anything they are stuck on) in the daily standups, so they can get feedback from each other as they go.

Get them demo their final version (should take < 5 minutes each) after the deadline.

The project is not formally marked but will help inform their Sparta Behaviours score for the week.

They can include it as a mini-project in their Profile - encourage them to continue to work on it even after the deadline, and put the GitHub link in their profile when it is ready.

## Further notes
A basic Radio GUI should display the strings return by the Radio methods.  

Once they have implemented the basic radio and GUI, check to ensure they haven't mixed radio logic code into the WPF code-behind classes.  

Then encourage them to be creative and add more functionality (which might mean changing the tests as well as adding new ones). 

They could enable and disable buttons depending on the Radio state, play sound files corresponding to each station, implement a volume changer, etc.  

One student has even created a fully functional streaming radio which was fantastic.  

**However** this isn't the expectation for all students - tell them to start with the basic functionality and **incrementally** add more, rather than diving in to more complex functionality and getting stuck. 

## Learning Outcomes
* Create moderately complex C# programs 
* Write unit tests for C# classes
* Use C# WPF – Windows Presentation Foundation – to create a small application with a Graphical User Interface
